#Python3 code to find nth ugly number

#Ugly numbers are those number whose prime factors are 2, 3 or 5.
 #From 1 to 15, there are 11 ugly numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.
 #The numbers 7, 11, 13 are not ugly because they are prime. 
 #The number 14 is not ugly because in its prime factor the 7 will come.
